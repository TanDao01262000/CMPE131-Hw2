1. Does the change inside increment_int_a change the variable a after the function call?
    It does not change the value fo the variable a after the function call.

2. Does the change inside increment_int_b change the variable b after the function call?
    The value of b will be changed.

3. If they differ answer why? if not why not?
    For variable a, the reason for that is integer is immutable type, which passed to the function by value.
    For variable b, it will be changed since it is an array which passed by reference to the function, or mutable type.
